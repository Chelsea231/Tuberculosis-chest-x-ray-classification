Introduction
Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium, which is contagious and spreads through the community.TB is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. Every year, millions of people become ill with tuberculosis (TB). In 2018, approximately ten million people were infected with tuberculosis, and a million and a half people died as a result of the infection. The disease's impact varies greatly, from fewer than 5 to more than 500 new patients per 100 000 citizens each year, depending on the severity of the disease. The fundamental reason for this high death rate is a failure in tuberculosis detection: more than one-third of the approximately ten million tuberculosis incidents are not registered and detected. There were a slew of solutions developed.

Chest X-Ray is one of these procedures (CXR) Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the preferred method of TB diagnosis for most early cases, owing to the low radiation dose, low cost, wide availability distinguish it from other TB detection methods. Researchers have been working on developing a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to aid in the preliminary diagnosis of tuberculosis-related diseases using medical imaging for several decades. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have consistently outperformed other traditional recognition algorithms in terms of achieving superior performance for image-based classification and recognition problems, due to advancements in deep learning.

Project Overview
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs and is responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide each year. Early detection of TB is crucial in combating its spread and improving patient outcomes. As powerful models for extracting informative features from images, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated advantages in medical image recognition applications as well as other fields.. It is critical in this modern age to use X-rays to detect and classify diseases affecting the chest because of the limited number of qualified radiologists available in this field. We will look at the classification of tuberculosis in chest x-ray images using DenseNet and Deep forest models.

Motivation
The limited availability of qualified radiologists poses a significant challenge in diagnosing chest-related diseases, including TB. Automating this process using deep learning and image processing techniques can alleviate the strain on healthcare systems and improve diagnostic accuracy.
